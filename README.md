# Reinforcement-Learning-for-optimizing- Single Fault-Detection-and-Classification    
1. Objective:
Using Reinforcement Learning for optimizing Single Fault Detection and Classification.

2.Models for Single Fault:
For Single Fault scenarios, implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) combined with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture.

3.Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning:
Both models incorporate automatic hyperparameter tuning.
Hyperparameter ranges and values:
1) CNN Layers: 0–5
2) LSTM Layers: 0–5
3) Dense Layers: 0–5
4) Epochs: 50–900
5) Max Pooling Layer: 0–1
6) Drop Layer: 0–2
7) Batch Normalization Layer: 0–2
8) Batch Size: 64–150
9) Learning Rate: 0.001–0.0001

4.Output:
Generate bar graphs for each identified fault.
The output will provide a clear visualization of the identified faults based on the implemented models.
